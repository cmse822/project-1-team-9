# For a given matrix size N, what is the total number of floating point operations performed by this operator?
## For each element in the result matrix, there are N multiplications and N-1 additions. 
## Since there are N^2 elements in the result matrix, we multiply the above count by N^2.
## Therefore, the total number of FLOPs for the given matrix multiplication is:
$flops=N^2\times (N\times 2\times N-N)$
## Simplifying the expression:
$flops=N^3$
## So, the total number of floating-point operations is $N^3$ for a given matrix size N.
