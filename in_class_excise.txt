for s = 2,4,8,...,n/2,n:
    for i = 0 to n-1 with steps s:
        x[i] = x[i] + x[i+s/2]
    sum = x[0]

Analze the spatial and temporal locality of the algorithm and contract it with the standard algoritm 

sum = 0
for i = 0,1,2,...,n-1
    sum = sum +x[i]



The standard algorithm for summing all elements in an array (sum = sum + x[i]) 
has similar spatial and temporal locality characteristics, but it has a different time complexity. The provided algorithm is more efficient when parallelism can be exploited due to its divide-and-conquer nature.
